REACT NOTES
use cdn links by searching cdn react and pull it to the project
wth this we add react to our project.. copy the 2 script tags and just paste it above the end of body tag
what is cdn?

REACT is a javascript library
react needs a root for all the dom manipulation
    creating root and rendering inside it is a part of react dom hence "REACTDOM.createRoot"
react gives helper function to optimize frontend

const heading=React.createElement ("h1",{},"sup")
    here{} is used to enter the attributes of the tag like id and also user defined attributes
    like const heading=React.createElement("h1",{id:'heading',xyz:'abc'},"sup");
    createElement creates an object 
    and the render method is converting the object into its 
    specified tags and putting it up to the html


for nested elements we can pass an array of reactElement function in the 3rd parameter
to avoid nested function and complexity of creation of elements we use JSX


root.render() replaces everything inside the root present inside the div with id root becuase we defined it as our root

react can be applied to small part fo our website hence called library

and frameworks are something that we use it entirely to create the app
we do not use it to apply it in small part of our app
