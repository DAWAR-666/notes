REACT NOTES
use cdn links by searching cdn react and pull it to the project
wth this we add react to our project.. copy the 2 script tags and just paste it above the end of body tag
what is cdn?
wht is crossorigin?
REACT is a javascript library
react needs a root for all the dom manipulation
    creating root and rendering inside it is a part of react dom hence "REACTDOM.createRoot"
react gives helper function to optimize frontend

const heading=React.createElement ("h1",{},"sup")
    here{} is used to enter the attributes of the tag like id and also user defined attributes
    like const heading=React.createElement("h1",{id:'heading',xyz:'abc'},"sup");
    createElement creates an object 
    and the render method is converting the object into its 
    specified tags and putting it up to the html


for nested elements we can pass an array of reactElement function in the 3rd parameter
to avoid nested function and complexity of creation of elements we use JSX


root.render() replaces everything inside the root present inside the div with id root becuase we defined it as our root

react can be applied to small part fo our website hence called library

and frameworks are something that we use it entirely to create the app
we do not use it to apply it in small part of our app




EP2


npm- is not node package manager although it manages node packages but it has no full form
its a stndard repo for all the packages

when we create React app then npm is already inside it
we can add npm why typing npm init in terminal and it will ask few ques after which it will add package.json file
package.json - is configuration for npm it keeps the track of approx version of package installed

packages and dependencies are same thing on which our project is dependent upon
dependencies like bundler
bundlers like(webpack,vite,parcel) all are similar

there are 2 types of dependencies
one are dev dependencies other are normal
dev dependencies are required for developmet phase
normal our also used for production

npm install -D vite --> here -d represent that the dependicy is dev dependency and not normal dependencies
version shows ^(caret) instead of ~(tilde) where ^ will automatically update the version of vite
when new version is released


after installation package-lock.json comes in the repo
this keeps the track of exact version that is being installed
to avoid problems like project working on local but not on production
package-lock.json keeps a hash to verify whatever is there on my machine is the same version that is being deployed
keeps the track of all the exact version

after installation node modules are also installed
npm fetched all the code of vite and put it there
node modules fetches all the code of all the dependencies into our system
and we can now use that code
in the modules there are various files which are like transitive dependicies
thet is vite is dependent on other dependencies which are depenedent on other dependencies and so on
hence so many files in node modules

npm vite <html file name> = to create the app
npx- executing a package
the above cmnd will create a local server and host the html file on it


bringing react from cdn links are not good options



EP3
instead of npx command we can use npm scripts
in package.json file in script section
    we can add start:"parcel index.html"
    this will tell the start of our dev command
    and build:"parcel build index.html" this will create a production build 
after adding these things we need not write npx command anymore
we can write npm run start --> this will automatically run the start command mentioned under script section
or we can also use npm start this is only for start and not for build



react elements are kind of equivalent to dom elements
react.createElement is and object when we render this onto dom it becomes html
for multi line defination use () and write all the content of react element inside the parenthesis

what is jsx?
is js syntax which is easier to create react elements
and it is different from react,not a part of react
jsx is a html like syntax and not html in js
jsx is transpiled
jsx is not an appropriate javascript code it will show error if we try to run in browser console
but the parcel while rendering transpiles the code before it goes to js engine
and js engine receive the code that browser can understand
our code is readable due to the use of jsx

transpiled means the code is converted into code that browser and react can understand
transpiling is done by parcel using a package "BABEL"
jsx code is transpiled to react.createElement which is a js object which on further rendering becomes html element
use camelcase for attributes in jsx

babel is a open source javascript compiler 


react component
everything is a component (true)
but what is component?
    class based component
        old way of writing code
        nobody uses

    functional components
        new way of writing code
        just a normal js function which returns some jsx or react element
        always name it with capital letter
        define it using arrow notation
        const HeadingComponent=()=>(
            div
                h1 /h1
            /div
        );
        to render a component directly using render function we use root.render(<HeadingComponent />)
        here the headingcomponent is the name of component that is being render.replace it with the ones to be rendered

        to render another component inside other component
        write <name /> where you want to render it
        component composition is rendering other compnent inside another component
        multiple elements cant be returned in component ,all the elements must be defined inside a parent component
        we can define using normal function keyword also but arrow notation is kind of standard
        


        to put react element inside component we can write the variable name inside {} eg {title}
        and we put any js code inside {} which is present inside component

        inside a element also we can write element name between{} inside another react element 

        component cant be rendered inside any other element or component until they are initialised
