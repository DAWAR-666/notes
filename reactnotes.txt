REACT NOTES
use cdn links by searching cdn react and pull it to the project
wth this we add react to our project.. copy the 2 script tags and just paste it above the end of body tag
what is cdn?
wht is crossorigin?
REACT is a javascript library
react needs a root for all the dom manipulation
    creating root and rendering inside it is a part of react dom hence "REACTDOM.createRoot"
react gives helper function to optimize frontend
react is fast as it uses virtual dom manipulation
react is fast as it incorporates algorithm like reconciliation algo(react fiber)
    due to this efficient dom manipulation can be done
react is known as single page application by the usage of link tags (EP7)

const heading=React.createElement ("h1",{},"sup")
    here{} is used to enter the attributes of the tag like id and also user defined attributes
    like const heading=React.createElement("h1",{id:'heading',xyz:'abc'},"sup");
    createElement creates an object 
    and the render method is converting the object into its 
    specified tags and putting it up to the html


for nested elements we can pass an array of reactElement function in the 3rd parameter
to avoid nested function and complexity of creation of elements we use JSX


root.render() replaces everything inside the root present inside the div with id root becuase we defined it as our root

react can be applied to small part fo our website hence called library

and frameworks are something that we use it entirely to create the app
we do not use it to apply it in small part of our app




EP2


npm- is not node package manager although it manages node packages but it has no full form
its a stndard repo for all the packages

when we create React app then npm is already inside it
we can add npm why typing npm init in terminal and it will ask few ques after which it will add package.json file
package.json - is configuration for npm it keeps the track of approx version of package installed

packages and dependencies are same thing on which our project is dependent upon
dependencies like bundler
bundlers like(webpack,vite,parcel) all are similar

there are 2 types of dependencies
one are dev dependencies other are normal
dev dependencies are required for developmet phase
normal our also used for production

npm install -D vite --> here -d represent that the dependicy is dev dependency and not normal dependencies
version shows ^(caret) instead of ~(tilde) where ^ will automatically update the version of vite
when new version is released


after installation package-lock.json comes in the repo
this keeps the track of exact version that is being installed
to avoid problems like project working on local but not on production
package-lock.json keeps a hash to verify whatever is there on my machine is the same version that is being deployed
keeps the track of all the exact version

after installation node modules are also installed
npm fetched all the code of vite and put it there
node modules fetches all the code of all the dependencies into our system
and we can now use that code
in the modules there are various files which are like transitive dependicies
thet is vite is dependent on other dependencies which are depenedent on other dependencies and so on
hence so many files in node modules

npm vite <html file name> = to create the app
npx- executing a package
the above cmnd will create a local server and host the html file on it


bringing react from cdn links are not good options



EP3
instead of npx command we can use npm scripts
in package.json file in script section
    we can add start:"parcel index.html"
    this will tell the start of our dev command
    and build:"parcel build index.html" this will create a production build 
after adding these things we need not write npx command anymore
we can write npm run start --> this will automatically run the start command mentioned under script section
or we can also use npm start this is only for start and not for build



react elements are kind of equivalent to dom elements
react.createElement is and object when we render this onto dom it becomes html
for multi line defination use () and write all the content of react element inside the parenthesis

what is jsx?
is js syntax which is easier to create react elements
and it is different from react,not a part of react
jsx is a html like syntax and not html in js
jsx is transpiled
jsx is not an appropriate javascript code it will show error if we try to run in browser console
but the parcel while rendering transpiles the code before it goes to js engine
and js engine receive the code that browser can understand
our code is readable due to the use of jsx

transpiled means the code is converted into code that browser and react can understand
transpiling is done by parcel using a package "BABEL"
jsx code is transpiled to react.createElement which is a js object which on further rendering becomes html element
use camelcase for attributes in jsx

babel is a open source javascript compiler 


react component
everything is a component (true)
but what is component?
    class based component
        old way of writing code
        nobody uses

    functional components
        new way of writing code
        just a normal js function which returns some jsx or react element
        always name it with capital letter
        define it using arrow notation
        const HeadingComponent=()=>(
            div
                h1 /h1
            /div
        );
        to render a component directly using render function we use root.render(<HeadingComponent />)
        here the headingcomponent is the name of component that is being render.replace it with the ones to be rendered

        to render another component inside other component
        write <name /> where you want to render it
        component composition is rendering other compnent inside another component
        multiple elements cant be returned in component ,all the elements must be defined inside a parent component
        we can define using normal function keyword also but arrow notation is kind of standard
        


        to put react element inside component we can write the variable name inside {} eg {title}
        and we put any js code inside {} which is present inside component

        inside a element also we can write element name between{} inside another react element 

        component cant be rendered inside any other element or component until they are initialised






EP4
creation of food app
intro to props

PROPS
    they are just arguments to a functional components
    they are used to create dynamic elements which have similar structure but different data to be present in them
    they are javascript obeject and can be used inside{} and we can pass many prop during functional and need not define several parameter during function definition
    we can just write props in function definition parameters


config driven ui 

always use keys in map



EP5


    separation of components in different file
        import export
        export
            named and default
    

    hooks
        a normal js utitlity functin given by react
        it has super power with logic behind it
        2 imp hooks (usestate(),useeffect())
        behaves a s a normal variable
        NEVER UPDATE STATE VARIABLE DIRECTLY LIKE NORMAL VARIABLE WITH '='

        whenever a state variable changes react will re-render the component
        useState()
        never create outside of the component
        and create at the top of component
        and do not create inside any if else ,for loop,or function
            superpowerful state variable
                maintains the state of a component
            import it using named import from react
                import { useState } from "react"
            creation of state variable
                const [nameof variable]=useState()
        


        BTS OF REACT

         react uses RECONCILIATION ALGORTHIGM AKA REACT FIBER (change in UI)
            uses virtual DOM which is a representation of actual DOM
            uses diff ALGORTHIGM which finds the difference between updated virtual dom and previous virtual dom



EP6

MONOLITH ARCHITECTURE
MICROSERVICE ARCHITECTURE
    different service for different jobs

API CALLS IN REACT
 load=>render whatever element we have => api call => re render 
 above method is best as it enhances ux
useEffect()
basic nature is to be called after each render
if no dependency array ,it is called everytime that component inside which we have the function is rendered
    takes 2 argumenst 
        callback function(compulsory)
        dependecy array(optional) (can changes the behavior)
            if dependecy array is empty => then useeffect is called on initial render and just once,when the component is rendered on the first time
            if we put anything inside the dependency array then it will only be caleed whenever the depnedency changes
    useEffect(()=>{},[])

api call

shimmer ui

conditional rendering

whenever state variable changes,react triggers a reconciliation cycle(re renders the whole component)




EP7


routing
react router dom library
whenever we have to create route we have to develop routing configuration
    for this import {createBrowserRouter} from react-router-dom
    createBrowserRouter(takes array of object as argument)here each object defines the specific path and wht to do in that path
    we create this to tell what should happen on a specific path or route
    we can use another hook known as useRouteErorr if we geta  path that is not defined
to provide routing configuration to our app we also have to import router provider along with createBrowserRouter

children route
    used for sharing layout .
    like i want to keep the header intact so i put the about,err etc paths as a children of root path
    such that they can share the header component and the component as per the path can be rendered below it
    syntax=>
        children:[{path,element},{same}]

    <Outlet />
    to render specific component as per path we have to import Outlet component through react router dom
    and call it as normal component where we want to render the path specific components
    with this we need not put any if else condition for path to render any specific component

    to connect the about us text in header to the about component never use anchor tag to make it go to that path
    this will reload the whole page and make the process slower

    we can import Link component from reactRouterDom 
        instead of using anchor tag we can use link component 
            <Link to="/about"> about us </Link>
            this will link the text to the specified path and will not reload the whole page
            it will just replace or refresh the component taht is to be rendered 



there are 2 types of routing server side and client side
    server side
        we have different html and when we click on any anchor tag it will fetch the details of that html and reload the hwole page
        we make network call and that page is loaded
    client side
        here we do not make network call here all the code is present on the page
        we just ask for the refreshing of component which just replaces the component and do not reload the whole page
    




EP8



class based components
    its a class that extends react.component and 
    has a render method that returns a pices of jsx component
    when we load the class based component on our webpage that means we are loading the instance of that class
    never update state variables directly
    to update state in class component use this.setstate func

LIFE CYCLE OF CLASS BASED component
whenever the class component is rendered/loaded/mounted on the webpage
    then first its constructor is called then the render method is called
    there is method like render that is componentDidMount which is called when the rendering finishes
    or the render function is completed

    if a class comp is called inside another class comp. (parent child)
    then
    parent const
    parent render
    child const
    child render
    child compdid mount
    parent component did mount

check react lifecyle diagram for clarification
componentDidMount is used to make api calls
    similar to useEffect used in functional component 



EP9



optimisation
    
    chunking/code splitting/dynamic bundling/lazy loading/on demand loading
        do not load the large component whenevr we go to our main webpage rather load that component only when we go to it or click it
        eg.do not import that component like usual component rather use lazy and suspense component
            const grocery=lazy(()=>import("./component/grocery") );
            &&
            use suspunse component and wrap the grocery component when defining path in static router
            in element of the path write:
            <Suspense fallback={return a jsx}><grocery/><Suspense/>

            here fallback is used to load the jsx given in brackets to be loaded until the actual data of component that is to be loaded is received
    single responsibilty principle
        if we have a function a class or any comonent then it should perform only one task or should have only single responsibilty
custom hooks



EP10

styling
    sass
    scss
    styled components
    material ui
    bootstrap
    chakra ui

    tailwind
        generic css framework

    postcss is a tool that is used by typescript
        it is used for transforming css with javascript
        used to make parcel understand what we have written in tailwind
        parcel ko smjhane ke liye use hota hai ki tailwind me humne kya likha hai   





EP11




    higher order components 
        takes component as a n input and returns a new component

    controlled and uncontrolled components

    lifting the state up

    props drilling
        avoid it and use reactContext ,a global space so that any component can access that data
